# Piton Labs Frontend Interview

## You will need

* A modern version of nodejs.
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting started

To get started, pull this repo down and run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to get a live reloading copy of the site.

For javascript we will work in `/pages/javascript.js` and navigate to http://localhost:3000/javascript.

for typescript we will work in `/pages/index.ts`

## The task

In the components folder is a `card` component and an associated styles file. We want to make that look like this: https://xd.adobe.com/view/501614fc-799e-4b10-9edf-2ddeb68b62ce-0545/specs/. Each page is already loading test data into a hook that you can use.

## Goals

We will take about 30 minutes of you working through this on screen share. There is not expecation that you will finish the task in this time, the only goal is to see how you work on frontend code.
